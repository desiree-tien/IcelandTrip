        <p>Well its been 3 days back and I am completely overwhelmed by the amazing things I saw there. I am also remarkably grateful that the water here doesn't smell like eggs, that I cannot be snowed in to my place of residence, and food doesn't cost a million dollars</p>
        <p> For now I'll just cover some of the highlights briefly about our trip and then go into detail on each one later.</p>
        <p> First we were snowed into our beautiful vacation rental for the first 5 or so days. We made it out ocassionally, but we didn't have nearly enough groceries and we had to be plowed out daily in order to leave. While there we went ot Geysir and to Gulfoss, both were incredibly beautiful and strange.</p>
        <p> Gullfoss, was mostly frozen, but still very powerful and large for a waterfall, the crevas it created reminded me of a frozen over Big Bend. Geysier was a blast, literally. We wandered around looking at the pools of water, while the primary one would blast of randomly.</p>
        <p> Upon moving to stay in town we did a south coast adventure where we saw more waterfalls, black sand beaches, and basalt colmns. As well Snealleas National Park, where we saw some other beautiful basalt formations as well as a seal harbor. </p>
        <p> We also did a whale watching tour where we saw a couple dolphins but I primarily spent much of my time seasick (Yuck!) We did a northern lights boat tour where not only were the water smoother, but I took a pill that made the experience much more enjoyable. One thing I found really intresting is that the nothern lights are never as bright as the pictures depict, to the naked eye. It's the long exposure on camera that allows them to look that incredible</p>
        <p>I also got to finally experience the thing I've been dreaming about, which was the geotherman hot spring, the Blue Lagoon. It was incredible, I also discovered there my new favorite cider which is Somersby's cider.</p>
        <p>So those are the highlights, I'll try to take some more time to go into depth later, but it was an incredible trip.</p>
