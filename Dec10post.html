      <p>Less than 30 days out an the panic and rush has started to set in. Trying to accquire last minute things that we might need. Gabe's boots were purchased earlier this week, and he's been weaing them almost everywhere to break them in. <br>
    <br>
        I ordered longjohns from amazon (fingers crossed they actually fit us) with some fleece lined leggings. I am suddenly worried that my jacket is too thick and will be too warm, and all other jackets will be not heavy enough. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    I have to remember on my previous trip to London that I way overpakced and should have just taken the staples of what I already wear and work with that, rather than buying a ton of one of items that I am likely to never wear again.
    <br>
    <br> 
    All that being said I do feel as if we are pretty well prepared, with pretty much everything we need. Hats, scarves, gloves, boots, warm socks, long johns, etc. Also purchased some blister stuff just in case we need them. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    People have also been asking us about what our itinerary is, and if I'm perfectly honest. We have none. Other than the Blue Lagoon on the 13th, we're just gonna show up and figure it out as we go along. I know we'll want to do an ice caves tour at some point- but other than that it's gonna be a "wake up and figure it out" kinda thing.  </p></div>
