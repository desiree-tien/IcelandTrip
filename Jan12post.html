      <p>Update, my longjohns fit. But not my fleece lined leggings. So that's a return to amazon I need to figure out. Still waiting on a few more pieces, but I'm over all feeling better about trying to pack my clothing away. I am going to still need to get a set of fleece lined leggings.

    Thankfully the dog situation has been taken care of- Luna to my mom's and Butter's to stay with our friend Maggie. Now that Butters has recovered from her spay, and will get groomed before hand. They'll both be ready to go.
